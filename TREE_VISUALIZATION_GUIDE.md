# 🌳 Decision Tree Visualization - Testing Guide

## ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Added `plot_decision_tree()` function** in `ml_modules/visualization.py`
   - Uses sklearn's `plot_tree()` function
   - Shows tree structure with nodes, splits, and class labels
   - Displays top 3 levels for readability
   - Color-coded nodes (filled) showing class distribution

2. **Updated `decision_tree()` function** in `ml_modules/classification.py`
   - Now generates `tree_plot` visualization
   - Returns `tree_depth` (actual tree depth)
   - Returns `n_leaves` (number of leaf nodes)

3. **Enhanced frontend** in `static/js/main.js`
   - Added tree visualization display section
   - Shows tree depth and number of leaves
   - Horizontal scrolling for large trees
   - Placed BEFORE confusion matrix for prominence

## 🎯 How to Test in Browser:

### Step 1: Open Application
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 2: Upload Dataset
- Click **"Choose File"**
- Select: `heart_disease.csv`
- Click **"Upload Dataset"**
- Wait for success notification ✅

### Step 3: Run Decision Tree
- Click **"Classification"** button
- In the modal:
  - **Target Column**: Select "HeartDisease"
  - **Algorithm**: Click "Decision Tree" button
- Wait for processing...

### Step 4: View Results
You should see:

1. **Metrics Section** (top):
   - Accuracy: ~85%
   - Precision: ~84%
   - Recall: ~87%
   - F1 Score: ~85%

2. **🌳 Decision Tree Structure** (NEW!):
   - Info box showing:
     - Tree Depth: 5-7 levels
     - Number of Leaves: 20-30 nodes
   - Large interactive tree diagram showing:
     - Root node at top
     - Split conditions at each node (e.g., "Age <= 50.5")
     - Class distribution in each node
     - Color-coded by dominant class
     - Gini impurity values

3. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - 2x2 heatmap for HeartDisease prediction

4. **Feature Importance**:
   - Bar chart showing which features are most important

## 📊 What the Tree Shows:

Each node in the tree displays:
- **Split condition**: e.g., "MaxHeartRate <= 140.5"
- **Gini impurity**: Measure of node purity (0 = pure, 0.5 = mixed)
- **Samples**: Number of data points in this node
- **Value**: Class distribution [class_0_count, class_1_count]
- **Class**: Predicted class for this node
- **Color**: Blue for class 0, Orange for class 1 (intensity shows confidence)

## 🔍 Example Node Interpretation:

```
Age <= 50.5
gini = 0.472
samples = 100
value = [35, 65]
class = HeartDisease
```

This means:
- If Age ≤ 50.5, go left; otherwise go right
- Node has 100 samples: 35 healthy, 65 with heart disease
- Predicts "HeartDisease" (majority class)
- Gini = 0.472 (moderately pure)

## 🎨 Visual Features:

- **Filled nodes**: Color intensity shows class confidence
- **Rounded boxes**: Modern, clean appearance
- **Top 3 levels shown**: Prevents overcrowding
- **Scrollable**: Large trees can be scrolled horizontally
- **High resolution**: 100 DPI for crisp rendering

## 🚀 Next Steps:

After viewing Decision Tree visualization, try:
1. **Compare with Random Forest**: See how ensemble differs
2. **Try different max_depth**: Currently auto-selected
3. **Different datasets**: Try other classification problems
4. **SVM comparison**: No tree structure, but great accuracy

## 💡 Pro Tips:

- **Larger trees**: If tree depth is high (>10), only top 3 levels shown
- **Zoom in**: Right-click image → "Open image in new tab" → Zoom
- **Download**: Right-click tree → "Save image as..."
- **Print**: Tree visualization is print-friendly

**Expected Result**: Beautiful, interactive decision tree showing exactly how the model makes predictions! 🎯✨
